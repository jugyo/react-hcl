- Use Bun instead of Node.js (`bun`, `bun test`, `bun install`, `bunx`)
- Custom JSX runtime — not React. `jsxImportSource` is `"react-hcl"`
- Start each task by reading `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- For developer-facing changes, also check `docs/development.md`
- Design docs and implementation plan are in `docs/`
- Write all code comments, test names, and commit messages in English
